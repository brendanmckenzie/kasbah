## Analytics vs. Logging

The system will hold the concept of Analytics and Logging, from an outside perspective it could be easy to confuse the two.  However an easy way to describe the function of each is simply like so.

* Analytics track events going on with the public website, pages being viewed, user interactions, etc...
* Logging track events going on with the administrative site and any informative messages useful for debugging issues with the public site.
