# Basic tutorial

This tutorial will take you through the process of starting a new Kasbah website.

The end result will be a basic blog with the ability to search and assign tags to blog posts.

Obviously blogs are very common place, the purpose of this tutorial is to give you, the developer, an understanding as to what is involved in building Kasbah backed solutions.

This blog will have 3 page types -

1. The home page
2. The blog post page
3. The search results page

There will be 3 data models used -

1. The website root
2. The home page
3. The blog post

There will be 3 React components registered with Kasbah -

1. Blog content
2. Search results listing
3. Blog listing

The steps involved with setting this all up will come later in the tutorial.

The first step is to [setup the project](/tutorial/basic/setup.md).
