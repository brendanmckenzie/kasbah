# Motivation

The content management system, service, platform is no doubt a fairly cluttered arena. Every system offers the same core functionality, but the way they go about it differs fundamentally.

How developers extend these platforms varies drastically; the infrastructure required to run websites on these platforms varies even further.  Some require multiple servers to handle the authoring and delivery of content, processing and reporting on analytical usage of the websites hosted.

Kasbah was built with three primary objectives.

1. Be developer friendly
2. Offer content authors a powerful yet simple interface - not only for authoring content, but also configuring the layout of the content
3. Run efficiently on minimal infrastructure while offering a feature loaded experience

The goal is to find the right balance between giving developers the freedom to build platforms for content authors to work with, while giving contnet authors the power to present their content in a meaningful manner.

A tertiary goal is to provide this all at a minimal cost.  The end user of the platform should be paying their development team to deliver a quality product rather than spending their budget on licensing and infrastructure.
